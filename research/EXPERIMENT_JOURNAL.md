## Day 1 — baselines (exchange X-D01-S01-0003)

### E001 · H001 global mean (incumbent) · COMPLETE
- Development mean RMSE **580.79** (R1 560.33, R2 437.07, R3 532.05, S1 746.06, W1 628.41; S1c 746.25, W1c 628.36).
- Matches the pre-registered expectation (RMSE ≈ fold std). The pipeline is validated end to end.
- Decision: incumbent by pre-registration. Analysis: `experiments/E001/analysis.md`.

### E002 · H002 airport median · COMPLETE → PROMOTE (champion)
- Development mean **553.74**. Against E001: mean dRMSE −27.05 s (q95 −24.51). All 7 folds WIN; tail share 0.037; no row concentration.
- Reproduction E007 (seed 43) is identical. LFPG shows the expected small forward exposure (S1 400.5 against S1c 412.6).

### E003 · H003 airport × hour median · COMPLETE (comparison pending)
- Development mean 548.42.

### E004 · H005 anchor `MVT − AOBT_3` · COMPLETE (comparison pending)
- Development mean 550.65. This is far worse than the audit's all-row 384.9 s. See its analysis once compared.

### E005 · H004 ridge FS0 · COMPLETE (comparison pending)
- Development mean 482.73. Within CLASS-S (94 s, 3.76 GB peak, under the 4 GB target).
